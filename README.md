- 👋 Hi, Welcome to my profile🪐@YuhaoQIAN

I’m 渝昊, but it’s okay to call me Ewan (I have no choice). I am a curious learner exploring the world in this wonderful life. 

👨‍💻 Consultant at EY Financial Services

💡 Studying Digital Transformation

⌨️ Also learning "the code thing"

📜 Project Management Professional (PMP)® & PMI Citizen Developer Practitioner (PMI-CDP) Certified

🏔 Mountaineering, swimming and volleyball

🌻 Charity enthusiast


I used to be an entrepreneur, photographer, streamer, security guard, broker and salesman, I got lost. But I re-examined myself and found a new way to life with a laptop in my backpack, and a passion in my heart.
